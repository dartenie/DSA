## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of self-contained, thoroughly tested packages for **generic data structures, algorithms, and containers**. Everything is written in pure TypeScript with no external dependencies.
Additionally, it includes a mini-framework for local development of LeetCode challenges and solutions to all challenges I've personally completed (updated frequently).

## (Why) Should you use this?

- **Learning Resource**: Useful for Students or anyone interested in CS concepts.
- **Reference Material**: Use it as solid references for implementing various data structures and algorithms.
- **Projects**: Before using any of the packages in this repository you should consider reviewing the provided benchmarks (where available) to ensure they fit your requirements. Also make sure the implementation aligns with your usecase or expectations.
